# Super Zen

Super Zen is an [Espresso][esp] theme, with a dark background and pretty colors. I guess it's a little bit inspired by [Monokai][monokai] and [D is for dark][disfordark], but my goal was to make a dark theme with pink colors that worked well with JavaScript.

Right now it works with JavaScript, CSS, HTML and PHP.
