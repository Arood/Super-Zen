# Super Zen

Super Zen is a "color palette" for programmers with a dark background and pretty colors. I guess it's a little bit inspired by [Monokai][monokai] and [D is for dark][disfordark], but my goal was to make a dark theme with pink colors that worked well with JavaScript.

It was originally created for [Espresso][esp], but I recently switched to [Sublime Text 2][sub], so I made a quick port of the theme there. It should also be compatible with [TextMate][mate], but I haven't tried it myself.

Right now it works with JavaScript, SASS, CSS, HTML and PHP.
